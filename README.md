# DataEngineerPath – Data Engineering Roadmap

A sleek, single-page roadmap for becoming a data engineer — with a little boisy-rap swagger.  
It includes curated **websites & YouTube** resources, **Azure** coverage (ADF, Synapse, Databricks, Storage), and a **South African market & finance** section (JSE, SARB, Stats SA, Treasury, FSCA, SARS).

## ✨ Features

- Glassmorphism UI with animated accents (equalizer “beat” bar)
- Sticky header + scroll progress bar
- 5-phase learning roadmap (Foundations → Advanced)
- Essential tools grid (Python, Spark, Airflow, Docker, **Azure**, etc.)
- “Learn” hub (websites + YouTube channels)
- 🇿🇦 South African finance links (JSE, SARB, Stats SA, Treasury, SARS, FSCA)
- Accessible, responsive, and lightweight (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)
